Simple_Data_Base_Manager_In_C++(Fall2016)

A simple DB Manager written in C++. A small individual class project.

Functionality:
Reads an input file with comma separated values, removes the duplicates, and writes a new comma separated database file 
without the duplicates (prompts a user for the database file name, opens the database, reads in the records using a 
custom class to hold a record, removes the duplicates, writes the scrubbed database as a  new CSV file starting with 'new_' 
and the input database file name, writes a new DB file to the same directory that the database file was read from).
